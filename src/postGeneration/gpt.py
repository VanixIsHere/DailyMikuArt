I would like you to generate me a prompt. This prompt is intended for generative AI models, and as such should begin with our protagonist Hatsune Miku. Miku is celebrating the holiday of Eid Al-Fatir. The start of the prompt should begin with "Generate art of Hatsune Miku where she is". From there, I need a verbose description of the celebration that she is participating in. Make sure describe a typical location that Eid Al-Fatir would be celebrated from. Miku should be there celebrating with people of various descents. The nationalities of these people should be the same as those that typically celebrate Eid Al-Fatir. A description of her clothes should be included. They should be a mish mash combination of her usual attire plus a bit of a cultural twist from one of the nations with which Eid Al-Fatir is celebrated. Lastly, take note to describe some of the details of the scene, such as the lighting conditions, weather conditions, or the time of day and how it reflects the objects in the scene. REMEMBER, since this scene is for art generation, I NEED this description to reflect a static place in time. Miku is only in one place doing one thing. The output MUST be at most 9 sentences long.
