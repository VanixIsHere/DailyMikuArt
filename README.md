## __What does this bot do?__

Hereby, the program will be referred to as 'Miku' directly.
Due to her daily upload schedule, Miku is paying close attention to the specific date. The current date is utilized to influence Miku's posts, as there are a number of different styles that she will choose to upload.

**1. Miku will celebrate various holidays.**

  As a worldwide virtual pop sensation, Miku has a worldly knowledge of other nations and their traditions. Using the date, she is able to determine if one or multiple countries is celebrating a holiday. If multiple holidays are occurring on the same date, she will determine the best holiday to acknowledge based on the number of nations that celebrate it. She has a slight bias towards specific countries. If there are still multiple holidays to choose from after the filtering process, then one will be picked at random.

###### Prompt Tip: Hatsune Miku is well intentioned, but sometimes messes up (she's trying her best). When generating DALL-E art for 'celebrating a holiday', it is very common to see American food items appear. This is not ideal for judaistic holidays where they follow a Kosher diet. In the same vein, pork items may be generated when celebrating various holidays for Abrahamic religions.
